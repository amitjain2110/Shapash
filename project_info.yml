Data Preparation:
  variable filetring: All variables that required special knowledge or previous calculations for their use were removed
  individual filtering: only the most recent sales data on any property were kept (for houses that were sold multiple times during this period)
  missing values: were replaced by 0
  Feature engineering: No feature was created. All features are directly taken from the dataset. Categorical features were transformed using an ordinal encoder.

Model training:
  Used algorithm: We used a RandomForestRegressor algorithm (scikit-learn) but this model could be challenged with other interesting models such as XGBRegressor, Neural Networks, ...
  Parameters choice: We did not perform any hyperparameter optimisation. Future works should be planned to perform gridsearch optimizations.
  Metrics: Mean Squared Error metric
  Validation strategy: We splitted our data into train (70%) and test (30%)
